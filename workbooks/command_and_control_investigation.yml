how_to_implement: This workbook has all the necessary process review tasks for any organization to quickly review any MITRE Command and Control related events in addition to other network assorted events.

This workbook and the supporting playbooks provide a `base` model and could and should be mondified for specific events that warrant a change in tactics like ransomware for example.  This workbook should be aligned with Splunk detections on the security domain `network`.

The workbook has all the necessary playbooks attached to the tasks, but not all workbooks are required to be visable and customer descresion can be use for what playbooks need to be visiable.  This is only for validation of exection of the workbooks without going to the activity pane. This workbook also has an LDAP integration to assist in gathering cusotmer and host infomration. This is not required, but recommended.

If some other more suitable CMDB environment is available customers should include that data as appropriate for their operations. Because of all the additional Splunk prebuilt queries with in the automation pieces, you will need a Splunk asset created on Phantom or SOAR products.
