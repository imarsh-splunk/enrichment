  Validate email indicators existence, reputation, detonation and determine if Phish, Spam, Suspicious or Clean ?
  Analyst should be reviewing SPF, DKIM, DMARC along with To: and Reply to: fields for non-matching data. Does the subject contain suspicious content. Is there a file or url? Does the x-origin-ip come from the same location and the sending domains? Does the email body seem too good to be true or create a sense of urgency?
