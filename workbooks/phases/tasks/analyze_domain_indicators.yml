description: Validate indicator existance, reputation, detonation and determine if Known APT, Commodity, Suspicous or Not Malicious?

  This should be for domain analysis.
  1. If Splunk present, run Splunk Query on each indictor and prevelence in the environment. Summarize number of times indicator seen in the last 24 hrs, 7 days, 1 month, six months increments. Return the hosts that have used this indictor. (make an artifact for each host?)
    a. search -> ```| stats ...```
  2. Gather reputational, intelligence and general information regarding indicator into a note (a note for each indicator)
  3. Perform any additional research regarding indicators and understanding what normal behaviour is or should be by using using search engines, knowledge bases etc.
  4. Make a determination of indicator, Known APT, Commodity, Suspicous or Not Malicious and whether to tag to block indicator
    a. This should align to a severity change (Known APT = High, Commodity = Med, Suspicous = Low, Not Malicious = Info)
    b. Change container and artifact severity and tag artifact & indicator(s) with blocked and determination tag

how_to_implement: 1. These should be domains that are not related to urls and should be separately reviewed.
