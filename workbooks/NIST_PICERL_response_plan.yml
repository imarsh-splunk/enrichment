name: "PICERL Response Plan"
id: 8a7ea67a-dd53-468e-aeef-b75aed0a877c
description: The NIST incident response process has several phases. This response plan describes the four major phases of the incident response processes that are `preparation`, `detection and analysis`, `containment, eradication and recovery`, and `post-incident` with the activities in detail. Customers should use this process to build effective incident response plans.  This particular response template aligns NIST 800-61r2 model to the PICERL (preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, lessons learned format produced by SANS Cybersecurity Training Organization.

how_to_implement: Organizations should use this response plan as template to define the processes for their security operations teams.
    With this as the template and then customizing the response plan around attack vectors. Organizations can fashion a framework for thier response procedures.
    Response plans and response procedures are different in the setting that procedures should have the actual step-by-step actions vs an response plan that discuses and deomonstrates actions without specifcs and aligns to the policy. Preparation should not be imported into response tools that support ingestion (hive, phantom, xsoar, etc). `Preparation` should not be imported into response tools.
