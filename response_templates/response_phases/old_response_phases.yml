      the adversary, the data that is likely to be targeted, the systems that may
      have been breached, and any other knowledge from further investigation. Query
      the logs of any available systems around the time of the incident for context
      and additional leads. If possible analyze and/or reverse engineer any executables
      or scripts discovered in the investigation. Try to determine exfiltration mechanisms,
      protocols, ports, IP addresses, hostnames, URL's, and other indicators.

    description: Identify and ingest the suspicious email into Phantom. Actual steps
      vary depending on how the Phantom event is created and where the suspicious
      email resides. For example, if the suspicious email is sent to a dedicated email
      address for suspected phishing attempts, Phantom can poll that inbox directly
      with an App such as IMAP, EWS for Exchange, EWS for Office, or GSuite for GMail.
      This will create the event in Phantom and populate it with email headers, URL
      artifacts, domain artifacts, file attachments, to/from addresses, the text of
      the raw email, and other metadata. Alternatively, if the email is not already
      ingested directly into Phantom the "get email" action may be useful to retrieve
      it. For example, if a Splunk Notable Event based on the Email datamodel is used
      to detect a suspicious email, Phantom may be able to run "get email" to ingest
      the email based on the IMAP UID or other identifier. Another possible scenario
      is that the email of interest is included as an attachment on the email received
      by Phantom. In this case the "extract email" action may be able to ingest the
      email if it is in the .msg or .eml format.

      need to be written to extract or reformat fields from the email. Be aware that

    description: Perhaps the most common email attack vector is a clickable link that

      it may lead the user to download a malicious file, or it may simply gather preliminary
      fingerprint information about the user to inform further operations. Investigate

      information to see if the URLs are linked to known malicious activity. Check

      a unicode substitution, or an out-of-order domain name. Also consider using

      a sandboxed URL detonation, a website scanning tool such as urlscan.io or SSL
      Labs, a manual inspection from a sandboxed environment, or a website screenshot

      other publicly available information to establish a sense of trust or an illusion
      of urgency. Social engineering is perhaps the hardest technique to detect in
      an automated fashion, often requiring manual investigation. Consider the context
      of the message, the intended recipient, and the identity of the sender or alleged
      sender. It may be necessary to ask the recipient user if they think the email
      is legitimate.
